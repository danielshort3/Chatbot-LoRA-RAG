Colorado National Monument's tall south-facing cliffs provide warmth and protection, allowing year-round flowering for an array of beautiful colors. For higher elevations like the Grand Mesa, aim for late May-early June to hike alongside columbines, delphiniums and mountain bluebells, whose blooms last until early July, depending on the weather. Many wildflowers, including common lupine, sun spots and sneezeweed, bloom in July and continue into early fall, so you are bound to see a kaleidoscope of colors along the trails.

This is a tradition that is still carried out today. Every 4th of July you can watch climbers carry the flag up Independence Monument and then proudly stake it at the top. Safety gear has come a long way in the past 100+ years. Today, climbing rope is stronger than steel, nuts and cams are strong enough to support anything short of an elephant, and harnesses and belay devices can quickly arrest a fall.
